# Typography.js Demo

This page uses themes from Typography.js to populate the `theme` object.
It's not currently a 1:1 replacement for all styles provided by Typography.js,
but is a demonstration of how it could fit in with the rest of Theme UI for users who
want to take advantage of Typography.js.

## Usage

```sh
npm i theme-ui-typography
```

Use the `toTheme` function to create a base `theme` object based on Typography.js options or a preset Typography.js theme.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import { toTheme } from 'theme-ui-typography'
import wp2016 from 'typography-theme-wordpress-2016'

const theme = toTheme(wp2016)

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
)
```
