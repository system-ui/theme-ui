# Themed component

Use the `Themed` components dict to render UI with styles from
[`theme.styles`](/theming#styles) _outside_ of MDX. For example, if you'd like
to reuse heading styles in a React component, you can use the `Themed.h1`
component to render an `<h1>` element with styles from `theme.styles.h1`.

```jsx
// example
import { Themed } from 'theme-ui'

export default (props) => (
  <div>
    <Themed.h1>Hello, styled heading!</Themed.h1>
  </div>
)
```

For a full list of keys available, see the
[Theme Specification docs](/theme-spec#styles).

## Changing the HTML element or component

The rendered HTML element can be changed for each `Themed` component. This can
be useful for ensuring accessible, SEO-friendly, and semantically-correct HTML
is rendered while leveraging styles from the theme. This API originated in
Rebass and is similar to the `@emotion/styled` API.

The following example renders a `<div>` that is styled like an `<h2>` element.

```jsx
// example
<Themed.h2 as="div">Hello!</Themed.h2>
```

This can also be used to style components like the Gatsby `Link` component to
match other links.

```jsx
<Themed.a as={Link} to="/about">
  About
</Themed.a>
```

## Global Styles

To add base typographic styles to the `<html>` element, add styles to
`theme.styles.root`. Previous versions of Theme UI used the `Themed.root`
component. See the [theming docs](/theming/#root-styles) for more information.
